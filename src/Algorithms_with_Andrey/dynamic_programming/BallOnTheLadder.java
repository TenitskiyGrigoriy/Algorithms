/**
 * At the top of a ladder containing N steps, there is a ball that starts jumping down them to the base.
 * The ball can jump to the next step, to the step after one or after 2.
 * (That is, if the ball lies on the 8th step, then it can move to the 5th, 6th or 7th.)
 * Determine the number of possible " routes" of the ball from the top to the ground.
 *
 * Input data
 * A single number 0 < N < 31 is entered.
 *
 * Output
 * Print a single number â€” the number of routes.
