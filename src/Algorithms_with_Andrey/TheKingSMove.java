/**
 * The chessboard field is defined by a pair of numbers (a, b), each from 1 to 8, the first number specifies the column number,
 * the second â€“ the row number. Two cells are specified. Determine whether the chess king can get from the first square to the second in one move.
 *
 * Input data
 * Given 4 integers from 1 to 8 each, the first two set the initial cell, the second two set the final cell.
 * The start and end cells do not match. The numbers are written in separate lines.
 *
 * Output data
 * The program should output YES if it is possible to get to the second square from the first square by the king's move, or NO otherwise.
