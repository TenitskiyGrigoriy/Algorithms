/**
 * Write a program that will execute a sequence of queries like ADD num, PRESENT num and COUNT (without a parameter).
 * The program must be written using the template type set.
 *
 * Executing each ADD num request should add a num element to the set (if there is already such an element,
 * adding another copy does not change the set), nothing is displayed on the screen.
 *
 * When executing each request of the form PRESENT num, the message "YES" or "NO" (in capital letters, in a separate line)
 * should be issued, according to whether there is such an element in the set; the value of the set does not change.
 *
 * When executing each COUNT query, the current number of different elements in the set
 * should be displayed on the screen in a separate line; the value of the set does not change.
 *
 * Input data
 * The first line of the standard input stream contains the number of requests N (1 < N < 100000),
 * followed by N lines, each of which contains one request in agreement
